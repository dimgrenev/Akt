# Akt — a powerful typeface for modern user needs

**Unified glyphs width** across all weights (thin → black), ensuring predictable line and UI-element width behavior during text weight adjustments. This attribute also aids in optimizing text density for dark themes – simply shift one weight step lighter for balanced contrast.  
**Capitals** are vertically **centered within the line height**, creating harmonious alignment with icons. **Terminals** (endpoints of rounded strokes) are horizontally **calibrated** for visual consistency.  
**1,200+ glyphs** and supports **400+ languages** using **Extended Latin & Cyrillic** scripts. Designed by Dima Grenev.
